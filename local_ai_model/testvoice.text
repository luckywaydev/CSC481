Hello, today we are going to test the CSC481 project, 
which is a speech-to-text project. 
This audio has been authorized for testing. 
Hello, Professor Sumana is very nice. 
I never get an A grade. Why am I even doing this project? Am I doing it just to avoid getting an F? 
Just kidding, I love you, Professor
